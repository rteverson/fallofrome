COURSE DESCRIPTION

An interdisciplinary investigation of the period ca. 300—800 AD. The traditional model of Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" will be considered in the light of modern conceptions of "Late Antiquity" by scholars such as Peter Brown, who see this as a period of sometimes dramatic cultural and political transformation, defined by the growth of the vibrant new kingdoms of Western Europe, and the development of Christianity and Islam. Using the methodologies of Ancient History, Archaeology, Art History and Classics, the course will consider these two approaches through the lens of material culture. How and why did cities, sculpture, religious art, pottery, textiles, military equipment and luxury goods change during this period, and what do they all reveal about how and why Rome fell—if it did at all?



COURSE OBJECTIVES
To obtain a solid outline of the history of the Late Antique west.
To understand how material culture changed during this period.
To gain familiarity with the main approaches scholars use to analyze the historical and material culture developments in this period.
To be able to assess the validity of claims about how and why this period marks a turning point in western history.
To assess the claims made by historical maps of this region and period.
An introduction to Carto, and github.
An introduction to elementary digital cartography.



COURSE OVERVIEW AND A NOTE ON ITS INTERDISCIPLINARY NATURE 

We will meet twice a week to discuss a selection of texts, artworks, archaeological sites and monuments from 306 AD to ca. 800 AD. As we work through the course, you will design and develop an online map that explores one of the ways the material culture of this period changed in relation to the historical changes at work in the late Roman  / early Medieval world.
This course uses two broad disciplinary “families” to study the question of how the western Roman world changed between 306 and ca. 700 AD: those, such as classics and history, that look first to written primary sources, and those, such as art history and archaeology, that look first to objects and their contexts. Although these disciplinary boundaries are porous, they have given rise to varying toolkits used by professional scholars working in those disciplinary traditions.
	Each week of this course, the readings will present you with information about the period you need to know, and, more importantly, a disciplinary skill for assessing that information. In class, we will discuss the author’s application of that skill, and then practice it for ourselves on a different piece of evidence from the period.
	Part of the work you are expected to do, is to “mix and match” skills and evidence from different weeks—to ask yourself what would or does the author from week 4 make of the evidence from week 6. This is only possible if you take proper notes for each week of the course.
	Finally, it is a central hypothesis of the course that these four disciplines can be brought into conversation via cartography. The bulk of our energy in and out of class will be spent thinking about how evidence from texts and objects can be used to construct a historical map. This will allow you to see the period and the way it has been studied in a new, and powerful, way. But it will require a great deal of the practical, repetitive work of converting data—historical, art historical, archaeological, and classical—into mappable formats. This is not optional, and you should only take this course on the clear understanding that the price of the exciting vantage offered by an interdisciplinary approach is always more time spent sorting evidence and data.




REQUIRED BOOKS
Mitchell, Stephen,  A History of the Later Roman Empire, AD 284–641: The transformation of the ancient world. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2007). 
Maas, Michael,  Readings in Late Antiquity: A sourcebook. (London: Routledge, 1999).


GRADING, and POLICIES:

Instructor Availability:

This is a particularly busy term for me. My wife and I are expecting our first child on August 28, and I am teaching on both campuses. This shouldn’t affect you a great deal, but I would be extremely grateful if you could give me as much notice as possible about scheduling meetings. I encourage you to meet with me at least once during the term.

I will usually be available for consultation after class. Please also feel free to contact me via email with questions at any time, but please allow 2 days (usually much less) for a response. Please don’t be shy about following up after the 2 days.  It is in your best interests to meet me at least once during the semester.  Good times to make an appointment include two weeks before an exam, the month before a research deadline and the week before a presentation.  

This class requires you to learn a variety of new skills. I encourage you to reach out to me and to technology instructors Shawn Hill and Katherina Fostano  as you encounter bugs and hiccups. 

Late Work: 
Work submitted late will be penalized by 3 points a day. Work submitted more than a week late will not be read.

Absence and late arrival:
Students are expected to attend every class, arrive on time, and sign in. Unexcused absences will result in a 2 point drop in your final grade, as will repeated lateness. Two absence on the grounds of serious illness, religious holidays, bereavement in the family, and required participation in University activities will be excused, provided you email me or your dean as soon as is practicable. In the event of more absences, or unexplained absences, you will be expected to consult with me and a dean.


Academic Integrity:
You are reminded to familiarize yourself with Fordham’s polices on grading and academic integrity (http://legacy.fordham.edu/UndergraduateBulletin/). We all hold ourselves to the following standard:

“As a student of Fordham University, I recognize that I am part of a community dedicated to the disciplined and rigorous pursuit of knowledge and communication of truth. I therefore commit myself to the University Code of Conduct and upholding the highest standards of academic integrity. Any work that I claim to be my own will be my own; I will give appropriate credit where credit is due; I will be fair and honest in all of my interactions with members of the Fordham community.”

We will discuss correct procedures for academic research, and citing sources, as part of this course. 

Technology and Email:
You are expected to check your Fordham email regularly for updates about the course, assignments, and other class-related communication. If you aren’t getting the course emails, let me know immediately as this will make it dramatically harder for you to do well.

Class materials and announcements are posted to the course github site (https://github.com/rteverson/fallofrome). You are expected to check for new materials, and to make use of the uploaded powerpoints, handouts, and study materials.

If you ever have any technological difficulties accessing github, omeka, or carto, please email me. No question is too small. Computer malfunction is not an acceptable excuse for late / missing work.

Accommodations for Learning
If you are a student with a documented disability and require academic accommodations, you need to register with the Office of Disability Services for Students (ODS) in order to request academic accommodations for your courses. Please contact the main ODS office at Rose Hill at 718-817-0655 to arrange services. Staff at ODS can walk you through the process and arrange registration appointments. Accommodations are not retroactive, so you need to register with ODS prior to receiving your accommodations. Please see me after class or during office hours if you have questions or would like to submit your academic accommodation letter to me if you are already registered for accommodations with Fordham.


COURSE REQUIREMENTS (must be completed to pass the course)
Good attendance record; classroom participation; all assigned readings; two exams; one short presentation on either an archaeological or literary source; one final mapping project. You must complete all assignments in order to pass the course. 



Participation, Preparation and Presentations (20%) 

Your participation is class is an important part of your grade. Thoughtful contributions and active listening will help you and your peers to learn, and enthusiasm for the material will be duly reflected in your final grade. To that end, no communication devices (cell phones, etc.) will be tolerated in class. Laptops are allowed, but if you use them to distract yourself or your peers, your grade will suffer.

Intelligent participation requires good preparation. We will spend part of each class discussing aspects of each reading. Read and note each assigned reading carefully. For most weeks, a particular approach or focus for the week’s reading is given. You will be asked direct questions about these in class! If you don’t know the answer a few times don’t worry, but repeated inability to recall the reading should prompt you to reassess your study habits. 

Once during the semester you will be asked to go beyond the reading, by using the footnotes to look up a primary source an author discusses, and an archaeological field report an author cites. You will be asked in class to offer a brief analysis of how or if the primary evidence supports the secondary author’s claims.

At Fordham, four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction. In some weeks, optional coding sessions will be offered, at the instructor’s discretion.



Map project: (30%): due December 16.

Topic selection: September 14
First set of evidence mapped and discussed: Sept 28
Scope document and bibliography: Oct 26
First draft of data mapped and discussed: Nov 20
Meeting with Carto specialist and  / or professor to discuss feasibility and minimum viable scope: week of Nov 26
Presentation: December 10 or Dec 16. 
Final draft: Dec 18.

The research component of this class will form two parts. 1) You will design and populate a meaningful online map that records how one dimension of the material culture of the Western Roman empire changed in the period the course covers. You may choose from any of the topics covered in the class: Urban planning; rural land use; religious objects; church building; luxury goods; ceramics; and portraits. Your map should contain at least 100 discrete data locations, and 10 footnoted text passages discussing what the data shows.  You will be introduced to the skills needed to construct such a map during class. 2) For you final exam, you will present to the class your map, its construction, and what it shows about the period of Late Antiquity.

Midterm exam: in class Thursday October 12 (25%)

The midterm will be an open book exam lasting 90 minutes.

Part I (30 minutes) Identification of slide IDs. You will be shown 6 slides of objects we have discussed in class. You will ID each (artist, title, date, location) and write a museum-style paragraph explaining its significance. 

Part II (30 minutes) You will be shown 3 unlabeled maps we have studied in class. You will identify the region and trend the map represents, and write a two-paragraph critique or assessment of its accuracy and effectiveness.

Part III (30 minutes) You will be asked an essay question (from a choice of 3) about a primary source we have discussed in class. You are expected to use the primary source, and visual and cartographic evidence to answer the essay question with a clear thesis.

Final Exam: December 10, 2.30pm, or December 16 TBD (25%)

A presentation of 15 minutes demonstrating the conclusions suggested by your mapping project, and the evidence underpinning them.


We will discuss techniques and strategies two weeks before each exam.

There will be no make-up tests without a note from either your advisor or the dean. 

Course Grades

Course grades are not scaled. Students will be graded with the numerical equivalent of an A, A-, B+, B, etc. Grades will be determined on the following basis:

Midterm Exam: 25%
Participation: 20%
Map project: 30%
Final Exam: 25%
