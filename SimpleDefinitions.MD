<H1> Useful Definitions of Maps </H1>

* “A graphic depiction of all or part of a
geographic realm in which the real-world
features have been replaced by symbols in
their correct spatial location at a reduced
scale.” (Clarke, 2001) (http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/old/gtech201/notes/6.introduction.to.cartography.slides.pdf)


* Cartography is very much a process of abstraction in which features of the real world are generalized or simplified to meet the demands of the theme and audience. Not all elements or details have a bearing on the pattern or process being studied and so some are eliminated to draw the reader's attention to those facts that are relevant. Too much detail can even hide or disguise the message of a map. The amount of detail that can be included is very much dependent on the scale at which the map will be produced, as the following examples demonstrate. A small-scale map of an area must, almost of necessity, be more generalized. Some automated systems now have the ability to provide assistance in the generalization and simplification of features. If such routines are not available, you should study a test plot of your map at its final scale. If linework or lettering touches itself and blurs together, you should consider generalizing the features and enlarging the lettering.

* Data frame
* Legend
* Scale
* North Arrow
* Background Data
* Locator Map
* Projection
* Symbolization: an unconscious mental process whereby one object or idea comes to stand for another through some part, quality, or aspect that the two share in common, with the symbol carrying the emotional feelings vested in the initial object or idea
* Labels
* Title
* Source of information
* Coordinate system

Most maps should have a clear and concise title, a notation on the scale (or if the map is not to scale), and, when needed for orientation, a north arrow.
