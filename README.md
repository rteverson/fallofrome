# Fall of Rome
CSV data for Professor Teverson's class on mapping the fall of the Roman Empire

As we go through the semester, you will need to update your group csv files here. At moments were we want to see what our class map looks like, we will merge the group branches back into the master branch.

The data we will create together will become complicated, and spread across multiple files and comptuers. Using github will help keep the versions organized, and will make it much less likely that you will wipe your own--or your colleagues'--hard-won data.

Another advantage of github is that it will only accept csv files--the format you need your spreadsheet data to be in for Carto to accept it.

I recommend that you download the github desktop client, as that makes uploading files to github from a folder on your computer easier.
